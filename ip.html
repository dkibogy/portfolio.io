    <img scr= "ip.jpg" alt= "Black girls who code community">
    <h2>Daisy's Bio</h2>

    <p> I have always had <em>an itch to learn something new</em>. Tech is on the fronteir of human development and that is why i want
      to be a <strong>Full-stack developer</strong> I like the tech space, it gives you the opportunity
       to branch out into multiple industries and success determined by practise and skill.
       My inspiration comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ6u4tCi4cY&t=6s/">Millenial Money</a>.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies and Interest</h3>
    <p>I love to read outside under trees, swimming and hanging out with friends. I'm not naturally creative but i try out some drawing, writing and poetry for banter and experience.
      I once wanted to be a youtuber haha who knows maybe one day.Listed below are other hobbies and interests;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Attending festivals and live concerts</li>
        <li>Wine and beer tasting</li>
        <li>tennis</li>
        <li>Travelling</li>

    <h3>Aspirations</h3>
    <p>I would like to create more open spaces so that kenyans can spend their free days outside with their families.
      The number of urban parks are too little and small for the amount of people living in Nairobi.
      Water parks, monuments and all the outside has to offer other than karura. I also would love to embrace tech in environment.
      I dont know how yet but there is still time.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
